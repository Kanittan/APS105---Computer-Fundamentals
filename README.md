# APS105: Computer-Fundamentals
Lab Projects completed in C Programming language at the University of Toronto in Winter 2021.

### **Labs Overview:**
**Lab** **1**- Simple Computation in C\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Program that reads in 3 numbers from the user through the keyboard, then output half of their sum, twice their product, and average &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the 3 numbers.

**Lab 2** - Programs that Calculate\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Part 1: Program that calculates Cash Back\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • A C program that calculate the total amount to pay, given that “for every 3 dollars spent on produce in the store, you get &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 cents cash back”.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • The program reads in the price per pound of the produce, the weight of the produce(in pounds) and outputs the total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;charge and the total savings rounded to two decimal places

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Program that round price to the nearest Nickel\


**Lab 3** - Simplified Blackjack Game\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accept and validate user input from the keyboard.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Use the user input to perform and output useful calculations.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Make decisions based on different conditions.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Loop a certain number of times based on different conditions.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Explicitly format the output of numbers.

**Lab 4** - Repetition and Decision Making\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 1: Program that calculates change containing minimum number of coins required\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Triangle Generator
       
**Lab 5** - Pascal Triangle: Prints out x rows of Pascals Triangle

**Lab 6** - Battleship Game

**Lab 7** - Reversi Game (Part 1)

**Lab 8** - Reversi Game (Part 2)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 1: Implements the specified Algorithm in Lab 7\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Implements our own Algorithm
      
**Lab 9** - Contact List
