Lab Projects completed in C Programming language at the University of Toronto in Winter 2021.

### **Labs Overview:**
**Lab** **1**- **Simple Computation in C**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Program that reads in 3 numbers from the user through the keyboard, then output half of their sum, twice their product, and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;average of the 3 numbers.


**Lab 2** - **Programs that Calculate**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Part 1: Program that calculates Cash Back\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • A C program that calculate the total amount to pay, given that “for every 3 dollars spent on produce in the store, you get &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 cents cash back”.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • The program reads in the price per pound of the produce, the weight of the produce(in pounds) and outputs the total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;charge and the total savings rounded to two decimal places
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Part 2: Price Rounding\
Program that round price to the nearest Nickel\

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Intial Deposit Amount (P)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Annual interest rate (r)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Number of times that interest is compounded per year (n)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Number of years the money is invested (t)\




**Lab 3** - **Simplified Blackjack Game**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Accept and validate user input from the keyboard.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Use the user input to perform and output useful calculations.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Make decisions based on different conditions.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Loop a certain number of times based on different conditions.
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Explicitly format the output of numbers.


**Lab 4** - **Repetition and Decision Making**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Part 1: Making Change\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Program that calculates change containing minimum number of coins required. (Quarter, Dime, Nickel, Cents)\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Part 2: Triangle Generator\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • C program that draws a triangle of a given number of rows (From 1-20).
       
       
**Lab 5** - **Pascal Triangle**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Program that prints out x rows of Pascals Triangle, where x is 0-13.


**Lab 6** - **Battleship Game**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Program that sets up the boards for the game.\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • In use one board will be set up according to user ("Player") input, another will be randomly generated for the opponent.


**Lab 7** - **Reversi Game (Part 1)**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Implements the specified Algorithm to play against computer.


**Lab 8** - **Reversi Game (Part 2)**\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 1: Implements the specified Algorithm in Lab 7\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Implements the specified Algorithm to play against computer AI.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Part 2: Implements our own Algorithm\
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Design and implement our own Algorithm to play against computer AI and other students.
